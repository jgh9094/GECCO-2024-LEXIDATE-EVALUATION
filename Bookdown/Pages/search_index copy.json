We compiled our data analyses and supplemental documentation into this nifty web-accessible book using bookdown. Our supplemental material includes the following: Hello world "],["accuraccy-results.html", "Chapter 2 Accuraccy results 2.1 Analysis setup 2.2 Accuracy per OpenML task", " Chapter 2 Accuraccy results Here we report the accuracy for final pipeline returned from a TPOT2 run on each OpenML task. 40 replicates were conducted for each evaluation strategy explored. 2.1 Analysis setup library(ggplot2) library(cowplot) library(dplyr) library(PupillometryR) scores &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./scores.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) scores$acro &lt;- factor(scores$acro, levels = NAMES) 2.2 Accuracy per OpenML task Accuracy of the returned pipeline from an evolutionary run. 2.2.1 Task 167104 filter(scores, taskid == task_id_lists[1]) %&gt;% ggplot(., aes(x = acro, y = accuracy, color = acro, fill = acro, shape = acro)) + geom_flat_violin(position = position_nudge(x = 0.1, y = 0), scale = &quot;width&quot;, alpha = 0.2, width = 1.5) + geom_boxplot(color = &quot;black&quot;, width = .08, outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.0, size = 0.8, position = position_nudge(x = .15, y = 0)) + geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = .015, height = .0001), size = 2.0, alpha = 1.0) + scale_y_continuous( name = &quot;Accuracy %&quot;, breaks = c(.74, .78, .82, .86), labels = scales::percent ) + scale_x_discrete( name = &quot;Treatment&quot; ) + scale_shape_manual(values = SHAPE) + scale_colour_manual(values = cb_palette, ) + scale_fill_manual(values = cb_palette) + ggtitle(&quot;Accuracy&quot;) + p_theme Summary statistics for the generation a satisfactory solution is found. performance &lt;- filter(scores, taskid == task_id_lists[1]) performance %&gt;% group_by(acro) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise( count = n(), na_cnt = sum(is.na(accuracy)), min = min(accuracy, na.rm = TRUE), median = median(accuracy, na.rm = TRUE), mean = mean(accuracy, na.rm = TRUE), max = max(accuracy, na.rm = TRUE), IQR = IQR(accuracy, na.rm = TRUE) ) ## # A tibble: 4 × 8 ## acro count na_cnt min median mean max IQR ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 10-fold cv 40 0 0.815 0.837 0.838 0.868 0.0143 ## 2 90/10 40 0 0.740 0.824 0.819 0.855 0.0264 ## 3 70/30 40 0 0.749 0.833 0.831 0.877 0.0187 ## 4 50/50 40 0 0.802 0.837 0.836 0.863 0.0132 Kruskal–Wallis test illustrates evidence of statistical differences. kruskal.test(accuracy ~ acro, data = performance) ## ## Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test ## ## data: accuracy by acro ## Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 21.695, df = 3, p-value = 7.55e-05 Results for post-hoc Wilcoxon rank-sum test with a Bonferroni correction. pairwise.wilcox.test(x = performance$accuracy, g = performance$acro, p.adjust.method = &quot;bonferroni&quot;, paired = FALSE, conf.int = FALSE, alternative = &quot;t&quot;) ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(xi, xj, paired = paired, ...): cannot ## compute exact p-value with ties ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(xi, xj, paired = paired, ...): cannot ## compute exact p-value with ties ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(xi, xj, paired = paired, ...): cannot ## compute exact p-value with ties ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(xi, xj, paired = paired, ...): cannot ## compute exact p-value with ties ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(xi, xj, paired = paired, ...): cannot ## compute exact p-value with ties ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(xi, xj, paired = paired, ...): cannot ## compute exact p-value with ties ## ## Pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction ## ## data: performance$accuracy and performance$acro ## ## 10-fold cv 90/10 70/30 ## 90/10 0.00016 - - ## 70/30 0.41651 0.08840 - ## 50/50 1.00000 0.00111 1.00000 ## ## P value adjustment method: bonferroni "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
